 * \brief \ref AmAudio to mix input
 *
 * AmAudio that mixes some sources' audio and writes into a set of sinks.
 *
 * Can probably do lots of things together with AmAudioQueue and/or AmAudioMixIn.
 *
 * Attention: Sources (in fact AmAudioMixerConnector) are owned by the AmAudioMixer,
 *            i.e. deleted on releaseSink/destructor.
 *            Sinks are not owned by the AmAudioMixer.
